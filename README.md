- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. Here are some tips to help with this:

1. Prioritize tasks: Always start with the most important tasks first. By doing this, you can ensure that you complete the tasks that are most critical to your project or assignment.
2. Plan ahead: Don't wait until the last minute to start working on a task. Instead, start planning ahead and creating a timeline for each task so that everything is completed on time. 
3. Stay organized: Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to keep track of your tasks and ensure everything remains organized and easy to access. These tools can also help to coordinate team efforts and communicate progress with colleagues.
